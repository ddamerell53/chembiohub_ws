A django project holder for the chembiohub web services project, submodules will be used for the app projects which are in concurrent development.

The concept of the project is to extend chembl_core_model and chembl_webservices to provide additional functionality. This will then be exposed in a separate angularjs app.

All relevant code is in the /src/ directory as sub repositories

These are installed in your local anaconda install as shown in [[install_anaconda.rst]]
