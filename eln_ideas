We have been misconceiving slightly what is AssayReg (to capture the assay) vs what constitutes the capturing of activity data

I propose a different definition:

InventoryReg - compound and other samples that don't have experimental data and a protocol linked to them
ChemReg - compounds or mixtures with experimental data against them
AssayReg - assay protocols or experiumental procedures for chemistry


This has led us to build the bulk upload functionality twice

It has also led us to create an activity search page that is way too complicated - realy you just want

compound, activity stats, experiment

experiment should then lead to the hierarchy of assayreg in reverse
there is scope for experiment to also contain a target hierarchy

this would be a much more usable activities search.

given that our default view of compounds is currently compound batches

we should just put the activity data in chemreg

the upload is much better tested and more fit for purpose

there is a natural 1 to 1 relationship between a compound batch and an activity
this is the format that everyone's data is in

assayreg instead functions as "drupal Lite" - a configurable tree-based CMS for experimental writeups and data that leads up to activities

If we need a specific link to "only the activities" in chemreg we can do that

Assayreg will reference "samples and sample data"  in one of its tabs on the bottom level 

each of these will be in chemreg

We can have 2 possible views - chemreg would be compounds with an associated experiment in assayreg, invreg would be everything else

We can add the data from reaction cdxml files as the prototype chemistry ELN - this will lead to a batch of each reaction component being registered in chemreg with the associated yield etc
